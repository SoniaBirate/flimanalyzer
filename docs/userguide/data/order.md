# Order Categories

The `Order Categories` tool adjusts the ordering of the categorical columns.

**Menu Access:** `Data` > `Order Categories`

**Toolbar Icon:** ![](/images/data/order.png)

This tool can be used to reorder the categorical columns, which are the columns with the highlighted headers (Cell, FOV, etc), and can also be used to edit the naming of identifiers within those categories.

## Example
In the following example, the data table's categorical columns in the order of Cell, FOV, Treatment. In the configuration settings for the `Order Categories` tool, the ordering is changed to Treatment, Cell, FOV. This change is materialized in a new table, created by the tool.

Note the small table under each of the categorical columns within the configuration. By double clicking on those cells, you can edit the names of those category identifiers.
