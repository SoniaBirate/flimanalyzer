# Sort
The `Sort` reorders the data rows in ascending order for a given data feature.

**Menu Access:** `Data` > `Sort`

**Toolbar Icon:** ![](/images/data/filter.png)

## Sorting the Data
Once a data set is open, locate the `Sort` option either from the menu or from the toolbar. Select the data feature for the rows to be sorted by. A new sorted table will be created, with the rows reordered based on ascending value of the selected data feature.

Here is a snippet of a data set before being sorted.
