# Saving Data

Data tables can be saved as comma separated value (csv) text files by clicking the `Save All` or `Save View` buttons in the data table sidebar.

* `Save All`: saves the original data, disregarding any active data filter settings.
* `Save View`: saves the data as currently displayed. Data hidden from view are not saved and cannot be retrieved from the saved file.
