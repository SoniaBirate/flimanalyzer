# Summary Statistics

Most analysis tools allow the grouping of data by categorical column values to summarize the underlying data. Grouping can be performed by single category or combination of multiple categories. Grouping by multiple categories follows a customizable hierarchical order. Changing the order of the grouping hierarchy changes ordering of rows of resulting data tables and data presentation in plots. The specific effects of different grouping hierarchies on data representation are analysis tool dependent and described with examples in the following subsections.
