# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

The `PCA` tool is used to decrease the dimensionality of the dataset, making it easier to interpret. The tool provides a lower number of dimensions for us to plot the datapoints, along with accuracy values for each dimension count so that we know how well the lower dimensions represent our dataset.

**Menu Access:** `Analysis` > `PCA`

## Running the Analysis

1. Go to the `Window` menu and select one of the data tables. This will bring the selected table window to the front.

2. Start the PCA tool by clicking on the icon in the toolbar or via the `Analysis` > `PCA` menu.

3. In the `Configuration: PCA` dialog, define `N-components`. This variable will control the number of components generated by the algroithm, based on the inputted variance perecentage. The value will default to 0.999, meaning that the algorithm will stop outputting new components once the 99.9% variance is met. Lower `N-components` values will produce a lower number of components.

4. Select the data grouping and data features of interest. Data grouping options are based on the tables category columns,  i.e. `Cell`, `Compartment`, `FOV`, and `Treatment` in this example. Data features correspond to columns with numeric data, `FAD a1`, etc..

    In the example, input data is not grouped, and all data features are selected. 
    
4. Click `OK`.

5. The analysis results are shown in two new data tables, as well as a histogram if the `Explained Histogram` checkbox is checked off. One of the new data tables contains the component values for each data point and standardized data feature value if the checkbox is selected, while the other contains the explained variance ratio for each component.

## Example Output
