# The Application Menu

## File

Clicking on `File` will open a drop-down menu with three options: `Open`, `Import`, and `Exit`. More information on loading data using the `Open` and `Import` options can be found in the [Loading Data](/userguide/data/load) section. The `Exit` option closes the FLIManalyzer program all together.

    
## Settings

Information about `Settings` can be found [here](/userguide/settings).

## Data

The `Data` menu item provides several options for adjusting your data. After having at least one data file open in FLIManalyzer, you may use these adjustment tools, which includes `Order Categories`, `Concat Data`, `Filter`, `Merge`, `Pivot`, `Sort`, and `Unpivot`. 

## Analysis

The `Analysis` menu item provides a drop-down menu of all the different analysis tools, which can also be accessed via their corresponding icons in the toolbar menu. Reference the Analysis section of the docs for more information on the specific tools.

## Window
The `Window` menu item is used to display all the opened windows, including data tables, plots, and analysis tools, for easy access. To exit out of all open windows, simply click `Close all windows`.
