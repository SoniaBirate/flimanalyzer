# The Application Menu

## File

Clicking on `File` will open a drop-down menu with three options: `Open`, `Import`, and `Exit`. More information on loading data using the `Open` and `Import` options can be found in the [Loading Data](/userguide/data/load) section. The `Exit` option closes the FLIManalyzer program all together.

    
## Settings

Information about `Settings` can be found [here](/userguide/settings).

## Data

The `Data` menu item provides several options for adjusting your data. After having at least one data file open in FLIManalyzer, you may use these adjustment tools. 

## Analysis

The `Analysis` menu item provides a drop-down menu of all the different analysis tools, which can also be accessed via their corresponding icons in the toolbar menu. Reference the [Analysis](/userguide/analysis) section of the docs for more information on the specific tools.

## Plots

The `Plot` menu item offers several different statistical plots that can be used to find data trends, provide a graphical representation of the data, and overall, make the data easier to interpret. Reference the [Plots](/userguide/plots) section of the docs for more information on the specific plots.


## Window
The `Window` menu item is used to display all the opened windows, including data tables, plots, and analysis tools, for easy access. To exit out of all open windows, simply click `Close all windows`.
